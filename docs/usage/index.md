# How to use Minerva

Refer to the [tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial.html) for an example step-by-step guide for how to use Minerva.

## Description
[//]: # This should be a brief, 1-2 sentence description
**MY SOFTWARE** performs this task. 

## Input
[//]: # Describe the input
An ```.ome.tiff``` and `markers.csv` file

[//]: # For inputs that require specific formatting, you may want to use sub-headings to describe those input formats. For example, a .csv may require specific formatting for the software, or a ome.tiff may need to be pre-stitched, etc.
### Example markers file
The markers file should be formatted in this way


## Output
A pyramidal, tiled ```.ome.tif```

## Usage:
MY SOFTWARE can be run with the following command
```
MY-SOFTWARE FILE [FILE ...] [OPTIONS] 
```

[//]: # Add an example of how to call the software with a simple set of inputs
For example, to run MY SOFTWARE on a set of data stored at my/path, with OPTION-Y set to 30:
```
MY-SOFTWARE FILE my/path --OPTION-Y 30
```
